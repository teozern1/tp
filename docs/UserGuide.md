# **TASsistant User Guide**

TASsistant is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) in NUS to track information about the students and professors
involved in tutoring. It is optimised for users that have experience with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and aims to be
able to handle contact organisation faster than GUI apps if the user can type quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Quick start**

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `TASsistant.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TASsistant.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TASsistant.jar` command to run the application.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Layout**

![layout image](images/GUI.png)

1. Module List: This is where all modules that you have added to the program will appear.
2. Tutorial List: This is where all tutorials that you have added to the program will appear.
3. Command Box: This is where you type in your commands. After typing the command, press `enter` to execute them. 
4. Output Box: This is where the program will provide feedback to your commands. When launching the program, the
output box will be empty, but after executing a command, successful or otherwise, the feedback of the program, such as
telling you that it doesn't recognise your command via an "Invalid command" message, will appear.
5. Person List: The list of people TAssistant is showing you. When launching the program, his will be everyone
TAssistant has data on, but you may filter the list of people with commands like
[find](#locating-persons-by-name-find) and [search](#search--search).
6. Assignment List: The list of assignments you have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Features**

**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order, except if the command requires an index. Indexes must always be put at the front. <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  e.g. if the command specifies `1 n/NAME`, `n/NAME 1` is NOT acceptable and may lead the program to read n/NAME as the index.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen,
