# **TAssistant User Guide**

## **Introduction**

TAssistant is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) in NUS School of Computing who are taking
multiple modules and tutorials with a large class size. It aims to help TAs track information more 
easily about the students and professors involved in tutoring. 

If you are experienced in using a Command Line Interface (CLI) and can type quickly, you will be able to
handle contact organisation faster than GUI apps.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Quick start**

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `TAssistant.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAssistant.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TAssistant.jar` command to run the application.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.


6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Layout**

![layout image](images/GUI.png)

1. Module List: This is where all modules that you have added to the program will appear.
2. Tutorial List: This is where all tutorials that you have added to the program will appear.
3. Command Box: This is where you type in your commands. After typing the command, press `enter` to execute them.
4. Output Box: This is where the program will provide feedback to your commands. When launching the program, the
output box will be empty, but after executing a command, successful or otherwise, the feedback of the program, such as
telling you that it doesn't recognise your command via an "Invalid command" message, will appear.
5. Person List: The list of people TAssistant is showing you. When launching the program, his will be everyone
TAssistant has data on, but you may filter the list of people with commands like
[find](#locating-persons-by-name-find) and [search](#searching-for-persons--search).
6. Assignment List: The list of assignments you have.

## **Features**

**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order, except if the command requires an index. Indexes must always be put at the front. <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  e.g. if the command specifies `1 n/NAME`, `n/NAME 1` is NOT acceptable and may lead the program to read n/NAME as the index.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen,
   and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.
   To resolve this, delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
